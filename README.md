## Description

This project investigates the theory and simulation of P-N junctions in semiconductors (Si, GaAs, AlGaAs, Diamond). It combines:

- **Theoretical research report** on junction physics, built-in potential, and device I–V characteristics.  
- **COMSOL Multiphysics models** to simulate 2D P-N junction behavior under forward bias across a range of doping levels (10¹⁴–10¹⁹ cm⁻³) and analyze the results to compare them with the analytical Shockley diode model.
